    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: August 17, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how lazycluster ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and
      discloses your information through our Chrome extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how lazycluster collects, uses, and discloses your information through its Chrome
      extension.
      We use LocalStorage to store certain preferences, such as theme settings, to enhance your experience. This data is
      saved locally within your browser and is not transmitted externally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, the extension saves the following information to your browser's LocalStorage:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Theme settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is processed solely for the functionality of the extension and is not transmitted externally. Data
      stored
      in LocalStorage persists until the extension is uninstalled.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      The information processed by the extension is used to provide and improve its functionality. LocalStorage is used
      to store your theme preferences, ensuring a consistent experience across sessions.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect or store any personal information, we do not have any data to secure. All processing is
      done locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The extension does not share any user-provided personal information with third parties without explicit user
      consent.
      If third-party sharing becomes necessary in the future, we will present the information to be shared and the
      purpose,
      and obtain your consent before proceeding.
    </p>


    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
      Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
