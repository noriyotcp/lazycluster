# Progress: LazyCluster

## What Works

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are created and initialized with basic content.
- **Project Context Documentation:** Research documents have been read and analyzed to understand project background, user needs, technical considerations, and design direction.
- **Memory Bank Update:** Core memory bank files have been updated with detailed information extracted from research documents, providing a comprehensive project context.
- **Technology Stack Defined:** Key technologies and frameworks (WXT, React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs, Tailwind CSS (conceptual), Shadcn UI (conceptual)) have been selected and documented.
- **System Architecture Outlined:** A modular system architecture consisting of Popup UI, Background Service Worker, and optional Content Scripts has been defined.
- **Documentation Setup:** `README.md` has been updated with project overview, technologies, and development plan. `docs/adr` directory and `docs/adr/template.md` have been created for Architecture Decision Records. `.clinerules` has been updated to reflect project standards.
- **Popup UI Implementation:** The popup UI has been implemented with a "Window Manager" button.
- **Manager Page Setup:** The basic structure for the main UI (manager.html) has been created as a React component in `entrypoints/manager`.
- **Added search bar to manager page:** Implemented a search bar in the manager page to filter tabs by title.
- **Resolved duplicate manager tabs issue:** The `openWindowManager` function in `entrypoints/popup/App.tsx` now prevents duplicate manager tabs from opening.
- **Implemented tab filtering:** The manager page now includes a search bar to filter tabs by title.

## What's Left to Build

- **Core Extension Functionality:**
  - Implement tab and window management features using Chrome Extension APIs (tab listing, searching, filtering, sorting, moving, closing, suspending, discarding).
  - Implement session saving and restoring functionality.
  - Implement window management features (creation, focusing, closing, optional naming).
  - Implement keyboard shortcuts for extension actions.
- **User Interface (Popup UI):**
  - Further develop the popup UI using React and Tailwind CSS (conceptual), Shadcn UI (conceptual).
  - Implement tab and window list display with different view options (list all tabs, group by window).
  - Implement action buttons and UI elements for tab and window management.
  - Integrate settings UI and Chrome Storage API.
- **Manager Page (Main UI):**
  - Implement tab listing using Chrome APIs.
  - Implement tab and window management features in the main UI.
- **Settings and Customization:**
  - Develop settings page UI based on design documents.
  - Implement settings for theme, tab display, keyboard shortcuts, auto-save, etc.
  - Integrate settings with Chrome Storage API to persist user preferences.
- **Testing and Refinement:**
  - Thoroughly test all features and UI components in the Chrome browser.
  - Gather user feedback and iterate on design and implementation.
  - Address any bugs, performance issues, or usability problems.
- **Chrome Web Store Deployment:**
  - Prepare extension package for submission to the Chrome Web Store.
  - Create store listing with descriptions, screenshots, and privacy policy.
  - Submit extension for review and publication.

## Current Status

- **Documentation setup complete (README.md, docs/adr, .clinerules).**
- **Popup UI implemented with "Window Manager" button.**
- **Basic structure for main UI (manager.html) created as a React component in `entrypoints/manager`.**
- **Added search bar to manager page:** Implemented a search bar in the manager page to filter tabs by title.
- **Resolved duplicate manager tabs issue:** The `openWindowManager` function in `entrypoints/popup/App.tsx` now prevents duplicate manager tabs from opening.
- **Ready to implement core extension functionality and UI development.**
