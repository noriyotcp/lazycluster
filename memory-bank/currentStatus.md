    - Modified `TabSelectionContext.tsx` to include `addTabsToSelection` and `removeTabsFromSelection` which accept an array of tab IDs.
    - Updated `WindowActions.tsx` to pass visible tabs to `WindowActions` and use the new context functions.
  - **Refactored `TabSelectionContext` to use a list of tab IDs for selection/deselection.**
  - **Refactored related components to remove unused props and state:**
    - Removed `isAnyTabCheckedInGroup` prop from `WindowActionsProps` in `WindowActions.tsx`.
    - Removed `isAnyTabCheckedInGroup` state, `handleAnyTabCheckChange` callback, and `onAnyTabCheckChange` prop from `WindowGroup.tsx`.
    - Removed `onAnyTabCheckChange` prop and related `useEffect` logic from `TabList.tsx`.
  - **Further refactored `TabSelectionContext.tsx`:**
    - Removed the now unused `addWindowTabsToSelection` and `removeWindowTabsFromSelection` functions.
    - Removed unused imports for `useToast` and `Alert`.
  - **Removed unused props, state, and functions related to the old bulk selection logic from `WindowActions`, `WindowGroup`, `TabList`, and `TabSelectionContext`.**
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Implemented responsive 2-column layout for window groups using Tailwind CSS Grid.
  - Adjusted layout breakpoints to `lg` for better responsiveness.
  - Added URL search functionality to the search bar.

  - **Refactored `TabSelectionContext` to use a list of tab IDs for selection/deselection, removing window-wide selection functions.**

## üß† Lessons Learned & Strategic Outlook

_(Captures insights, long-term goals, and unresolved questions.)_

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Added event listeners for tab movement enabled the UI to reflect tab reordering.
  - Recognized the importance of explicitly defining requirements for expected behaviors.
  - A review of the original "cluster" implementation could have prevented oversights.
  - Established the need to integrate unit and E2E testing to catch such issues early.
  - Leverage UI Framework Features: We initially overlooked the built-in Theme Controller component provided by daisyUI and attempted a manual implementation. Utilizing framework-provided features can significantly simplify development and improve efficiency.
  - Component Responsibility Separation: Creating dedicated single-purpose components improves code organization and reusability. By isolating the theme-switching functionality into its own component other components can focus on their primary responsibilities leading to better maintainability and clearer component design.
  - Importance of Iterative Improvement and Information Gathering: Initial approaches may not always be optimal. User feedback and continuous information gathering are crucial for identifying better solutions and iteratively improving implementations.
  - Value of PLAN MODE: Thorough planning in PLAN MODE is critical. A more in-depth plan can identify potential pitfalls early and reduce rework during ACT MODE.
  - Handling replace_in_file failures: When `replace_in_file` fails multiple times it is more efficient to use `write_to_file` as a fallback.
  - Naming Conventions: The importance of choosing clear and accurate names for props and states especially when dealing with complex logic and component hierarchies. Inconsistent or misleading names can lead to confusion and rework.
  - Iterative Naming Refinement: Naming is not always straightforward and may require iterative refinement as the code evolves and logic becomes clearer. Be prepared to revisit and adjust names as needed.
  - Prop Drilling and Context API: Prop drilling can complicate component relationships and make naming more challenging. Context API can be a valuable tool to simplify prop flow and improve code organization in such cases.
  - Client vs. Background Connection Responsibility: Understanding the distinct roles of client-side scripts (initiating connections, handling reconnects) and background scripts (listening for connections) is crucial for designing robust communication patterns in Chrome extensions. Background scripts typically don't initiate reconnections themselves.
  - Importance of Client-Side Connection Management: Implementing connection management (including automatic reconnection) on the client-side (e.g., using a custom hook like `useBackgroundConnection`) is essential for maintaining a stable connection to the background script, especially when the background script might be suspended and restarted by the browser.
  - **Clarity in Refactoring: When refactoring, clearly identify and remove all unused code (props, state, functions, imports) to maintain a clean and understandable codebase. This improves maintainability and reduces potential confusion for future development.**
  - **Impact of Context Changes: Modifying a shared context (like `TabSelectionContext`) can have cascading effects. It's important to trace all usages of the context to ensure all dependent components are updated correctly or that unused parts are thoroughly removed.**
- **Long-Term Goals:**
  - Implement settings page for user customization.
  - Explore possibilities of synchronizing saved windows across devices.
  - Improve performance and stability of the extension.
- **Unresolved Questions:**
  - How to best handle edge cases in tab management logic?
  - What are the most effective strategies for E2E testing of UI components?
  - How to implement cross-device synchronization of saved windows?
- **Working Assumptions:**
  - User feedback is crucial for iterative improvement.
  - Maintaining code quality and documentation is essential for long-term maintainability.
  - Performance optimization should be considered throughout the development process.
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Explore possibilities of integrating with cloud services for data backup and synchronization.
  - Investigate possibilities of adding more advanced tab management features, such as tab grouping and archiving.
  - Consider user interface enhancements based on user feedback and usability testing.
