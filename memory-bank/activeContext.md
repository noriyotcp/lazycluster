# Active Context: LazyCluster

## Role

- Track the current work focus.
- Document recent changes.
- Outline next steps.
- Record active decisions and considerations.

## Current Focus

- Outlining UI structure and components for the Manager Tab UI.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented a responsive 2-column layout for window groups using the `column-count` CSS property.
- Refactored `src/components/WindowGroupList.tsx` to use `columns-2` for multi-column layout.
- Removed Flexbox implementation from `src/components/WindowGroupList.tsx`.
- Removed `max-height` from `collapse-content` in `src/components/WindowGroup.tsx`.

## Next Steps

- Implement title truncation for long site titles.
- Implement the tab item links.
- Implement the search field clear button.
- Investigate and fix the favicon issue in the manager tab.
- Update the manifest.json description to 'lazycluster'.
- Configure dev mode data persistence.

## Active Decisions

- **Framework Selection:** Decided to use WXT (Web Extension Toolkit) as the preferred framework for development due to its Vite integration, HMR, and Chrome Extension specific features.
- **Technology Stack:** Confirmed technology stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs.
- **Design Principle:** Affirmed "Simple is the best" as the guiding design and development principle.

## Lessons Learned

- **API Selection:** We initially experienced issues by confusing `browser.runtime` with `chrome.runtime` APIs. In future projects, we will verify the project configuration (e.g., `wxt.config.ts`) early in the development process to ensure the correct API usage.

- **Tool Selection and Usage:** We encountered difficulties with the `replace_in_file` tool due to strict matching requirements. In cases of extensive or complex changes, using the `write_to_file` tool directly can be more reliable and save time.

- **Value of PLAN MODE:** This process highlighted the critical importance of thorough planning in PLAN MODE. A more in-depth plan could have identified potential pitfalls early and reduced rework during ACT MODE.

- **Context API and `createContext` Type Definition:** When using the Context API, it's important to consider the type definition of the context value. While it may seem safe to omit `undefined` from the type if the context is always provided within a specific component, including `undefined` and implementing an error check in the `useContext` hook can improve code safety and prevent unexpected errors if the context is accidentally used outside of its provider. This approach makes the code more robust and easier to maintain in the long run.
- **Leverage UI Framework Features:** We initially overlooked the built-in Theme Controller component provided by daisyUI and attempted a manual implementation. Utilizing framework-provided features can significantly simplify development and improve efficiency.

- **Component Responsibility Separation:** Creating dedicated, single-purpose components improves code organization and reusability. By isolating the theme-switching functionality into its own component, other components can focus on their primary responsibilities, leading to better maintainability and clearer component design.

- **Importance of Iterative Improvement and Information Gathering:** Initial approaches may not always be optimal. User feedback and continuous information gathering are crucial for identifying better solutions and iteratively improving implementations.
- **Handling replace_in_file failures:** When `replace_in_file` fails multiple times, it is more efficient to use `write_to_file` as a fallback.
