# Active Context: LazyCluster

## Current Focus

- Updating memory bank with research findings and finalizing initial project plan.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized memory bank core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` with detailed project overview, goals, and key features.
- Updated `productContext.md` with detailed problem description, solution overview, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps

- Update remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Outline system architecture and component relationships in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Detail technology stack and development setup in `techContext.md`.
- Define initial project status and next actions in `progress.md`.
- Potentially start outlining UI structure and components based on design documents.

## Active Decisions

- **Framework Selection:**  Decided to use WXT (Web Extension Toolkit) as the preferred framework for development due to its Vite integration, HMR, and Chrome Extension specific features.
- **Technology Stack:** Confirmed technology stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs.
- **Design Principle:**  Affirmed "Simple is the best" as the guiding design and development principle.
