# Active Context: Current Tasks and Status

_(Document tasks, goals, and active context for the current project. This helps maintain focus and track progress.)_

## Focus for Today

- Update documentation to reflect recent code changes.

## Current Sprint Goals

- Improve user interface and user experience of the extension.
- Enhance tab management functionalities.
- Ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Tasks in Progress

- Updating documentation for recent changes.
  - Update ADR documents to reflect the use of Tailwind CSS Grid for the 2-column layout.
  - Update README.md to include new features and updates.
  - Update other relevant documentation files as needed.

## Next Steps

- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` with the latest progress and lessons learned.
- Review and update `memory-bank/development-guidelines.md` to discourage the use of React.FC.
- Update `memory-bank/useContext-usage.md` to reflect provider component refactoring.
- Consider adding E2E tests for UI components.

## Blockers

- None at the moment.

## Decisions Made

- Implemented responsive 2-column layout for window groups using Tailwind CSS Grid.
- Adjusted layout breakpoints to `lg` for better responsiveness.
- Added URL search functionality to the search bar.
- Displayed domain on tab hover for better user experience.
- Refactored provider components to use `React.ReactElement` type for better type safety.
- Removed redundant `updateTabGroups()` call in `TabItem` to avoid double updating.
- Implemented keyboard navigation for TabList component using native `onKeyDown` event handler.
- Implemented focusing the search bar when the '/' key is pressed in the manager tab.

## Current Status

- Documentation updates are in progress.
- Code refactoring and improvements are ongoing.
- Core features are implemented and functional.

## Long-Term Goals

- Implement settings page for user customization.
- Explore possibilities of synchronizing saved windows across devices.
- Improve performance and stability of the extension.

## Unresolved Questions

- How to best handle edge cases in tab management logic?
- What are the most effective strategies for E2E testing of UI components?
- How to implement cross-device synchronization of saved windows?

## Working Assumptions

- User feedback is crucial for iterative improvement.
- Maintaining code quality and documentation is essential for long-term maintainability.
- Performance optimization should be considered throughout the development process.

## Future Considerations

- Explore possibilities of integrating with cloud services for data backup and synchronization.
- Investigate possibilities of adding more advanced tab management features, such as tab grouping and archiving.
- Consider user interface enhancements based on user feedback and usability testing.
