# Active Context: Current Tasks and Status

_(Document tasks, goals, and active context for the current project. This helps maintain focus and track progress.)_

## Focus for Today

- Update documentation to reflect recent code changes, specifically the bulk selection feature enhancement and related refactoring.

## Current Sprint Goals

- Improve user interface and user experience of the extension.
- Enhance tab management functionalities.
- Ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Tasks in Progress

- Updating documentation for recent changes:
  - Update Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect the completion of the bulk selection feature enhancement and subsequent refactoring.
  - Review if other Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) require minor updates.
  - Update ADR documents if any architectural decisions were implicitly made or changed.
  - Update README.md if new user-facing features were added or significantly changed.

## Next Steps

- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` with the latest progress and lessons learned from the bulk selection and refactoring tasks.
- Review and update `memory-bank/development-guidelines.md` to discourage the use of React.FC (if not already done).
- Update `memory-bank/useContext-usage.md` to reflect provider component refactoring (if applicable to recent changes).
- Consider adding E2E tests for UI components, including the updated bulk selection.

## Blockers

- None at the moment.

## Decisions Made

- Implemented responsive 2-column layout for window groups using Tailwind CSS Grid.
- Adjusted layout breakpoints to `lg` for better responsiveness.
- Added URL search functionality to the search bar.
- Displayed domain on tab hover for better user experience.
- Refactored provider components to use `React.ReactElement` type for better type safety.
- Removed redundant `updateTabGroups()` call in `TabItem` to avoid double updating.
- Implemented keyboard navigation for TabList component using native `onKeyDown` event handler.
- Implemented focusing the search bar when the '/' key is pressed in the manager tab.
- Implemented client-side reconnection logic using a custom hook (`useBackgroundConnection`) to improve connection stability between the manager UI and the background script.
- **Enhanced bulk selection to only target visible (filtered) tabs within a window.**
- **Refactored `TabSelectionContext` to use a list of tab IDs for selection/deselection, removing window-wide selection functions.**

## Current Status

- **Bulk selection feature enhancement (targeting visible tabs) is complete and tested.**
- **Related refactoring of tab selection logic and component props is complete.**
- Documentation updates are in progress.
- Code refactoring and improvements are ongoing.
- Core features are implemented and functional.
- Connection stability between the manager UI and background script has been improved with client-side reconnection logic.

## Long-Term Goals

- Implement settings page for user customization.
- Explore possibilities of synchronizing saved windows across devices.
- Improve performance and stability of the extension.

## Unresolved Questions

- How to best handle edge cases in tab management logic?
- What are the most effective strategies for E2E testing of UI components?
- How to implement cross-device synchronization of saved windows?

## Working Assumptions

- User feedback is crucial for iterative improvement.
- Maintaining code quality and documentation is essential for long-term maintainability.
- Performance optimization should be considered throughout the development process.

## Future Considerations

- Explore possibilities of integrating with cloud services for data backup and synchronization.
- Investigate possibilities of adding more advanced tab management features, such as tab grouping and archiving.
- Consider user interface enhancements based on user feedback and usability testing.

## Recent Changes

(Document recent changes made)

- Implemented a responsive 2-column layout for window groups using Tailwind CSS grid.
- Adjusted layout breakpoints to `lg` for better responsiveness.
- Added URL search functionality to the search bar.
- Implemented tab hover domain display in `src/components/TabItem.tsx`.
- Added functionality to focus the search bar when the '/' key is pressed in the manager tab (`entrypoints/manager/App.tsx`, `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/components/SearchBar.tsx`).
- Added toast error notification feature integrated in `TabItem` component.
- Refactored `entrypoints/background.ts` to extract connection handling logic into a `connect` function.
- Created `src/hooks/useBackgroundConnection.ts` custom hook to manage persistent connection to the background script with automatic reconnection.
- Refactored `entrypoints/manager/App.tsx` to utilize the `useBackgroundConnection` hook, replacing the previous direct connection logic.
- **Enhanced bulk selection in `WindowActions.tsx` to operate only on currently visible (filtered) tabs.**
  - Modified `TabSelectionContext.tsx` to include `addTabsToSelection` and `removeTabsFromSelection` which accept an array of tab IDs.
  - Updated `WindowActions.tsx` to pass visible tabs to `WindowActions` and use the new context functions.
- **Refactored related components to remove unused props and state:**
  - Removed `isAnyTabCheckedInGroup` prop from `WindowActionsProps` in `WindowActions.tsx`.
  - Removed `isAnyTabCheckedInGroup` state, `handleAnyTabCheckChange` callback, and `onAnyTabCheckChange` prop from `WindowGroup.tsx`.
  - Removed `onAnyTabCheckChange` prop and related `useEffect` logic from `TabList.tsx`.
- **Further refactored `TabSelectionContext.tsx`:**
  - Removed the now unused `addWindowTabsToSelection` and `removeWindowTabsFromSelection` functions.
  - Removed unused imports for `useToast` and `Alert`.
