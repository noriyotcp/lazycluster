# Active Context: LazyCluster

## Role

- Track the current work focus.
- Document recent changes.
- Outline next steps.
- Record active decisions and considerations.

## Current Focus

## Recent Changes

- Implemented a responsive 2-column layout for window groups using the `column-count` CSS property.
- Refactored `src/components/WindowGroupList.tsx` to use `columns-2` for multi-column layout.
- Removed Flexbox implementation from `src/components/WindowGroupList.tsx`.
- Removed `max-height` from `collapse-content` in `src/components/WindowGroup.tsx`.

## Next Steps

- Implementing the search field clear button.
- Investigating and fixing the favicon issue in the manager tab.
- Updating the manifest.json description to 'lazycluster'.
- Configuring dev mode data persistence.

## Active Decisions

- **Framework Selection:** Decided to use WXT (Web Extension Toolkit) as the preferred framework for development due to its Vite integration, HMR, and Chrome Extension specific features.
- **Technology Stack:** Confirmed technology stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs.
- **Design Principle:** Affirmed "Simple is the best" as the guiding design and development principle.

## Lessons Learned

- **Tool Selection and Usage:** We encountered difficulties with the `replace_in_file` tool due to strict matching requirements. In cases of extensive or complex changes, using the `write_to_file` tool directly can be more reliable and save time.
- **Value of PLAN MODE:** This process highlighted the critical importance of thorough planning in PLAN MODE. A more in-depth plan could have identified potential pitfalls early and reduced rework during ACT MODE.
