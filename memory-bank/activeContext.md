# Active Context: LazyCluster

## Current Focus

- Outlining UI structure and components for the Manager Tab UI.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized memory bank core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` with detailed project overview, goals, and key features.
- Updated `productContext.md` with detailed problem description, solution overview, and user experience goals.
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` with system architecture and component relationships.
- Updated `techContext.md` with technology stack and development setup.
- Updated `progress.md` with current project status and next actions.

## Next Steps

- Outline UI structure and components for the Manager Tab UI.
- Begin implementing the basic UI structure in React in `entrypoints/manager/App.tsx`.
- Set up a basic testing environment (e.g., Jest) and write initial unit tests.
- Continue to update memory bank files as development progresses.

## Active Decisions

- **Framework Selection:** Decided to use WXT (Web Extension Toolkit) as the preferred framework for development due to its Vite integration, HMR, and Chrome Extension specific features.
- **Technology Stack:** Confirmed technology stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs.
- **Design Principle:** Affirmed "Simple is the best" as the guiding design and development principle.

## Development Process Reflection

### Lessons Learned

- **API Selection:** We initially experienced issues by confusing `browser.runtime` with `chrome.runtime` APIs. In future projects, we will verify the project configuration (e.g., `wxt.config.ts`) early in the development process to ensure the correct API usage.

- **Tool Selection and Usage:** We encountered difficulties with the `replace_in_file` tool due to strict matching requirements. In cases of extensive or complex changes, using the `write_to_file` tool directly can be more reliable and save time.

- **Value of PLAN MODE:** This process highlighted the critical importance of thorough planning in PLAN MODE. A more in-depth plan could have identified potential pitfalls early and reduced rework during ACT MODE.

### Process Improvements

- Allocate more time in PLAN MODE for analysis and risk assessment before starting implementation.
- Standardize API checks at the beginning of projects to avoid misconfiguration issues.
- Develop guidelines for selecting appropriate tools (e.g., when to use `write_to_file` versus `replace_in_file`) based on the scale of the changes.
- Document lessons learned in a centralized location (e.g., this Active Context document) to inform and improve future development iterations.

### Lessons Learned - Search Bar Implementation

- **Tool Selection:** The `replace_in_file` tool proved unreliable for larger or complex changes. Using `write_to_file` directly is a safer option when facing difficulties with `replace_in_file`.
- **Testing:** It's crucial to carefully test changes after each tool use to catch errors early.
- **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling and validation to prevent tool failures.
