# Project Brief: LazyCluster

## Overview

lazycluster is a browser extension designed to simplify tab and window management, addressing the challenges users face with tab clutter and inefficient browser workflows. It is being developed as a replacement for the popular "cluster" extension, which is no longer functional due to changes in Chrome extension best practices. lazycluster aims to inherit the best aspects of "cluster" while incorporating user feedback and modern development practices to create a simple, intuitive, and efficient tab management solution.

## Goals

- **Efficient Tab and Window Management:** Provide users with tools to effectively organize and manage a large number of open tabs and browser windows.
- **Enhanced User Productivity:** Improve user workflow by enabling quick navigation, tab grouping, session saving and restoring, and efficient tab searching and filtering.
- **Resource Optimization:** Minimize system resource usage by implementing features like tab suspension and efficient memory management.
- **Simple and Intuitive User Experience:** Design a user-friendly interface that is easy to learn and use, adhering to the "simple is best" principle.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Ensure user privacy by not sharing information with third-party services and avoiding unnecessary data storage.

## Key Features

Based on the analysis of "cluster" and user needs, LazyCluster will include the following key features:

- **Window and Tab Overview:** A clear and concise overview of all open browser windows and tabs in a popup UI.
