## Overview

lazycluster is a browser extension designed to simplify tab and window management, addressing the challenges users face with tab clutter and inefficient browser workflows. It is being developed as a replacement for the popular "cluster" extension, which is no longer functional due to changes in Chrome extension best practices. lazycluster aims to inherit the best aspects of "cluster" while incorporating user feedback and modern development practices to create a simple, intuitive, and efficient tab management solution.

- **Efficient Tab and Window Management:** Provide users with tools to effectively organize and manage a large number of open tabs and browser windows.
- **Enhanced User Productivity:** Improve user workflow by enabling quick navigation, and efficient tab searching and filtering.
- **Simple and Intuitive User Experience:** Design a user-friendly interface that is easy to learn and use, adhering to the "simple is best" principle.

## Problem Addressed

Users face significant challenges in managing browser tabs and windows, leading to:

- **Tab Clutter:** Users often end up with a large number of open tabs, making it difficult to find specific tabs and causing visual clutter.
- **Inefficient Workflow:** Switching between numerous tabs and windows disrupts focus and reduces productivity.
- **Resource Consumption:** Keeping many tabs open consumes significant system memory and CPU, slowing down the browser and the entire system.
- **Limitations of Existing Tools:** Current browser features and existing extensions often fall short of providing a comprehensive and intuitive solution for effective tab and window management. Users find them either too basic, lacking essential features, or too complex and overwhelming to use.
- **Need for Simplicity:** Users desire a solution that is simple, intuitive, and easy to use, without a steep learning curve or feature overload. They want a tool that enhances their workflow without getting in the way.
