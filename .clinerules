# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in `/docs` when modifying features.
-   Keep `README.md` in sync with new capabilities.
-   Create ADRs in `/docs/adr` for significant architectural decisions.

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in `/docs/adr` for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Data storage schema changes

Follow the template in `/docs/adr/template.md` (create this template file).

## Code Style & Patterns

-   Follow project coding standards with emphasis on modular, component-based architecture (React components).
-   Use TypeScript best practices; enforce clear typing and consistent naming conventions.
-   Prefer composition over inheritance.
-   Utilize React Hooks for managing component state and side effects.
-   Follow a consistent error handling pattern.

## Testing Standards

-   Unit tests required for core business logic.
-   Integration tests for API endpoints and extension-specific functionalities.
-   End-to-end tests for critical user flows.
