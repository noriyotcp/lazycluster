# Progress: LazyCluster

## What Works

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are created and initialized with basic content.
- **Project Context Documentation:**  Research documents (`answer-deep-research.md`, `ask-deep-research.md`, `designs/gemini-2.0-flash.md`) have been read and analyzed to understand project background, user needs, technical considerations, and design direction.
- **Memory Bank Update:** Core memory bank files have been updated with detailed information extracted from research documents, providing a comprehensive project context.
- **Technology Stack Defined:** Key technologies and frameworks (WXT, React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs, Tailwind CSS/Shadcn UI (conceptual)) have been selected and documented.
- **System Architecture Outlined:**  A modular system architecture consisting of Popup UI, Background Service Worker, and optional Content Scripts has been defined.

## What's Left to Build

- **Core Extension Functionality:**
    - Implement tab and window management features using Chrome Extension APIs (tab listing, searching, filtering, sorting, moving, closing, suspending, discarding).
    - Implement session saving and restoring functionality.
    - Implement window management features (creation, focusing, closing, optional naming).
    - Implement keyboard shortcuts for extension actions.
- **User Interface (Popup UI):**
    - Develop the popup UI using React and Tailwind CSS/Shadcn UI (conceptual).
    - Implement tab and window list display with different view options (list all tabs, group by window).
    - Implement search and filter functionality in the popup UI.
    - Implement action buttons and UI elements for tab and window management.
    - Implement settings UI and integrate with Chrome Storage API.
- **Settings and Customization:**
    - Develop settings page UI based on design documents.
    - Implement settings for theme, tab display, keyboard shortcuts, auto-save, etc.
    - Integrate settings with Chrome Storage API to persist user preferences.
- **Testing and Refinement:**
    - Thoroughly test all features and UI components in the Chrome browser.
    - Gather user feedback and iterate on design and implementation.
    - Address any bugs, performance issues, or usability problems.
- **Chrome Web Store Deployment:**
    - Prepare extension package for submission to the Chrome Web Store.
    - Create store listing with descriptions, screenshots, and privacy policy.
    - Submit extension for review and publication.

## Current Status

- **Memory bank initialized and updated with research findings.**
- **Initial project plan and architecture defined.**
- **Technology stack and development setup configured.**
- **Ready to start implementing core extension functionality and UI development.**

## Known Issues

- **None identified yet.**  Further development and testing may reveal potential issues.
