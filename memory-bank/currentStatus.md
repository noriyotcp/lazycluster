# Project Status & Activity

## üéØ Current Focus & Immediate Tasks

_(This section outlines what's being worked on right now, next steps, and any blockers.)_

- **Focus for Today/Current Tasks:**
  - Update documentation to reflect recent code changes, specifically the bulk selection feature enhancement and related refactoring.
  - Updating documentation for recent changes:
    - Update Memory Bank files to reflect the completion of the bulk selection feature enhancement and subsequent refactoring.
    - Review if other Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) require minor updates.
    - Update ADR documents if any architectural decisions were implicitly made or changed.
    - Update README.md if new user-facing features were added or significantly changed.
- **Next Steps/Actions:**
  - Update this file (`memory-bank/currentStatus.md`) with the latest progress and lessons learned.
  - Review and update `memory-bank/development-guidelines.md` to discourage the use of React.FC (if not already done).
  - Update `memory-bank/useContext-usage.md` to reflect provider component refactoring (if applicable to recent changes).
  - Consider adding E2E tests for UI components, including the updated bulk selection.
- **Blockers:**
  - None at the moment.

  - Add more advanced tab management features.
  - Implement comprehensive E2E tests.
  - Finalize documentation and project cleanup.
- **Known Issues:**
  - Minor UI alignment issues in certain scenarios.
  - Potential performance bottlenecks with large numbers of tabs (Need further review and testing).
  - Need to implement more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

## ‚úÖ Recent Achievements & Decisions

_(Logs completed tasks, milestones, and significant decisions.)_

- **Recent Achievements/Milestones:**
  - Implemented a responsive 2-column layout for window groups using Tailwind CSS grid.
  - Adjusted layout breakpoints to `lg` for better responsiveness.
  - Added URL search functionality to the search bar.
  - Implemented tab hover domain display. (`src/components/TabItem.tsx` mentioned)
  - Refactored provider components to use `React.ReactElement` type for better type safety.
  - Removed redundant `updateTabGroups()` call in `TabItem` to avoid double updating.
  - Implemented keyboard navigation for TabList component using native `onKeyDown` event handler.
  - Added event listeners for tab movement tracking.
  - Implemented focusing the search bar when the '/' key is pressed in the manager tab. (files mentioned)
  - Added toast error notification feature integrated in `TabItem` component.
  - Refactored background script connection logic in `entrypoints/background.ts` by extracting it into a `connect` function.
  - Implemented client-side reconnection logic using the `useBackgroundConnection` custom hook in `src/hooks/useBackgroundConnection.ts`.
  - Refactored `entrypoints/manager/App.tsx` to use `useBackgroundConnection` for improved connection management.
  - **Enhanced bulk selection to operate only on currently visible (filtered) tabs.** (`WindowActions.tsx` mentioned)
    - Modified `TabSelectionContext.tsx` to include `addTabsToSelection` and `removeTabsFromSelection` which accept an array of tab IDs.
    - Updated `WindowActions.tsx` to pass visible tabs to `WindowActions` and use the new context functions.
  - **Refactored `TabSelectionContext` to use a list of tab IDs for selection/deselection.**
  - **Refactored related components to remove unused props and state:**
    - Removed `isAnyTabCheckedInGroup` prop from `WindowActionsProps` in `WindowActions.tsx`.
    - Removed `isAnyTabCheckedInGroup` state, `handleAnyTabCheckChange` callback, and `onAnyTabCheckChange` prop from `WindowGroup.tsx`.
    - Removed `onAnyTabCheckChange` prop and related `useEffect` logic from `TabList.tsx`.
  - **Further refactored `TabSelectionContext.tsx`:**
    - Removed the now unused `addWindowTabsToSelection` and `removeWindowTabsFromSelection` functions.
    - Removed unused imports for `useToast` and `Alert`.
  - **Removed unused props, state, and functions related to the old bulk selection logic from `WindowActions`, `WindowGroup`, `TabList`, and `TabSelectionContext`.**
  - Introduced `devLog` utility in `src/utils/devLog.ts` for development-only console logging.
  - Refactored `console.log` calls in `entrypoints/background.ts`, `entrypoints/manager/App.tsx`, `src/contexts/TabFocusContext.tsx`, and `src/hooks/useBackgroundConnection.ts` to use the new `devLog` utility. `console.error` and `console.warn` calls were intentionally kept for production visibility.
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Implemented responsive 2-column layout for window groups using Tailwind CSS Grid.
  - Adjusted layout breakpoints to `lg` for better responsiveness.
  - Added URL search functionality to the search bar.
  - Displayed domain on tab hover for better user experience.
  - Refactored provider components to use `React.ReactElement` type for better type safety.
  - Removed redundant `updateTabGroups()` call in `TabItem` to avoid double updating.
  - Implemented keyboard navigation for TabList component using native `onKeyDown` event handler.
  - Implemented focusing the search bar when the '/' key is pressed in the manager tab.
  - Implemented client-side reconnection logic using a custom hook (`useBackgroundConnection`) to improve connection stability between the manager UI and the background script.
  - **Enhanced bulk selection to only target visible (filtered) tabs within a window.**
  - **Refactored `TabSelectionContext` to use a list of tab IDs for selection/deselection, removing window-wide selection functions.**
  - Implemented a `devLog` utility to ensure `console.log` statements are only active during development, while `console.error` and `console.warn` remain active in production.
