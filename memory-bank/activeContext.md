# Active Context: LazyCluster

## Current Focus

- Updating memory bank with research findings and finalizing initial project plan.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized memory bank core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` with detailed project overview, goals, and key features.
- Updated `productContext.md` with detailed problem description, solution overview, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps

- Update remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Outline system architecture and component relationships in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Detail technology stack and development setup in `techContext.md`.
- Define initial project status and next actions in `progress.md`.
- Potentially start outlining UI structure and components based on design documents.

## Active Decisions

- **Framework Selection:** Decided to use WXT (Web Extension Toolkit) as the preferred framework for development due to its Vite integration, HMR, and Chrome Extension specific features.
- **Technology Stack:** Confirmed technology stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs.
- **Design Principle:** Affirmed "Simple is the best" as the guiding design and development principle.

## Development Process Reflection

### Lessons Learned

- **API Selection:** We initially experienced issues by confusing `browser.runtime` with `chrome.runtime` APIs. In future projects, we will verify the project configuration (e.g., `wxt.config.ts`) early in the development process to ensure the correct API usage.

- **Tool Selection and Usage:** We encountered difficulties with the `replace_in_file` tool due to strict matching requirements. In cases of extensive or complex changes, using the `write_to_file` tool directly can be more reliable and save time.

- **Value of PLAN MODE:** This process highlighted the critical importance of thorough planning in PLAN MODE. A more in-depth plan could have identified potential pitfalls early and reduced rework during ACT MODE.

### Process Improvements

- Allocate more time in PLAN MODE for analysis and risk assessment before starting implementation.
- Standardize API checks at the beginning of projects to avoid misconfiguration issues.
- Develop guidelines for selecting appropriate tools (e.g., when to use `write_to_file` versus `replace_in_file`) based on the scale of the changes.
- Document lessons learned in a centralized location (e.g., this Active Context document) to inform and improve future development iterations.
