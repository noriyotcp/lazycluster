## Recent Changes

(Document recent changes made)

- Implemented a responsive 2-column layout for window groups using the `column-count` CSS property.
- Refactored `src/components/WindowGroupList.tsx` to use `columns-2` for multi-column layout.

- Removed `max-height` from `collapse-content` in `src/components/WindowGroup.tsx`.
- Implemented bulk tab selection using checkboxes in `src/components/TabItem.tsx`.
- Added a trash icon to `src/components/Header.tsx` to trigger the close action for selected tabs.
- Implemented `TabSelectionContext` in `src/contexts/TabSelectionContext.tsx` to manage the state of selected tabs.
- Connected `TabItem` and `Header` components to `TabSelectionContext` to enable bulk tab closing functionality.
- Refactored prop name `onCheckAllTabsChange` to `onAnyTabCheckChange` in `TabList` component for better clarity.

## Next Steps

(List specific next steps related to the current focus)

## Active Decisions

(Record active decisions made in the current context)

- **Framework Selection:** Decided to use WXT (Web Extension Toolkit) as the preferred framework for development due to its Vite integration, HMR, and Chrome Extension specific features.
- **Technology Stack:** Confirmed technology stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Chrome Extension APIs.
- **Design Principle:** Affirmed "Simple is the best" as the guiding design and development principle.

## Lessons Learned

(Record specific lessons learned during the current sprint or task)

- **Tool Selection and Usage:** We encountered difficulties with the `replace_in_file` tool due to strict matching requirements. In cases of extensive or complex changes, using the `write_to_file` tool directly can be more reliable and save time.
- **Value of PLAN MODE:** This process highlighted the critical importance of thorough planning in PLAN MODE. A more in-depth plan could have identified potential pitfalls early and reduced rework during ACT MODE.
- **Incorrect Next Steps:** The Next Steps in `activeContext.md` included tasks that were not actually needed. In the future, we should confirm with the user before updating the Next Steps.
